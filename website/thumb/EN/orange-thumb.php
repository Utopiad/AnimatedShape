			Mobile network application available on mobile and desktop for professional to communicate easily, exchange documents and plan meetings or video call.<br><br>
			We provided a full follow-up management for that vast project, from the web design to the integration and the back development.  Our goal was to make the application both playful and effective. The user experience optimisation was essential not only for the dashboard which was very dense and complete, but also for the “call and video-call conferences” section. The challenge was to keep it clear and intuitive while there was a lot of functionalities to put on the same page
